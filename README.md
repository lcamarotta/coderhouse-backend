# ðŸ¤–  Fake e-commerce website
#### My project for the 'back-end' course of coderhouse.
The 'backend' folder contains a REST API with Node.js, Express and MongoDB I made to learn back-end programming.
The 'frontend' folder contains an e-commerce Single Page Application project I made using ReactJS with Vite.

The frontend renders cards with data fetched from the backend's endpoints and lets the user simulate a buying process.
When 'Send Order' is pressed it generates a ticket in the database with the items that were on the cart and an email is sent to the user with purchase details.

## How to run

#### Requirements

- Node.js
- NPM

```
/* Go to 'backend' folder and install the needed dependencies */

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/* After that go to 'frontend' folder and install the needed dependencies */
npm install

/* Then run */
npm run dev

```
